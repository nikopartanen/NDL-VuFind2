      <h2><i class="fa fa-search"></i> Free word search</h2>
      <p>Enter your search terms in the search box. In the drop-down menu at the end of the search box, you can choose to search by title, author or subject.</p>
      <p>Search terms separated by spaces use the AND search logic and will return results containing all of your search terms.<p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <pre class="code">mannerheim carl</pre>
      <p>produces the same search results as</p>
      <pre class="code">mannerheim AND carl</pre>
      <p>After starting your search, you can for example narrow your search results by permissible uses, type of material or date of manufacture.</p>
      <pre class="code">child</pre>
      <p>The search results return material related to children</p>
      <pre class="code">"children"</pre>
      <p>This is a targeted search in which the quotes limit the search results to those that contain the word ”children.”</p>
      <pre class="code">"University of Helsinki"</pre>
      <p>It’s always a good idea to put phrases like these in quotes so that Finna doesn’t interpret your search as separate words</p>
      <pre class="code">children summer</pre>
      <p>This search is the same as entering children AND summer; the search will include all results related to children and summer</p>
      <pre class="code">countryside OR farm</pre>
      <p>The search results will include results related to the countryside or to farms</p>
      <pre class="code">"kivi aleksis"</pre>
      <p>The author’s name should be in quotes, and ideally the last name should be entered first</p>
      <pre class="code">know*</pre>
      <p>The asterisk truncates words so that the search may return results with a number of different endings, e.g. knowledge and know-how</p>
      <p>If, for example, you enter the name of a book in the search box, Finna predicts your search terms by offering results that may allow you to find your book directly.</p>
      <p><strong>You can find more instructions on forming search phrases in  <a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'help-syntax'])?>">the Search syntax section</a>.</strong></p>
